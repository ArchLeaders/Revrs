**Revrs**, meaning *"reverse"*, is an endian neutral binary IO utility. It works by reversing data regions to swap endianness with zero addition allocations (hense the name **Revrs**).

## Usage

Currently there is no proper documentation, only an [API](https://archleaders.github.io/Revrs/api) reference and source code.
